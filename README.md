# Flexible-Gripper-Design-3D-Printing.
Project Title : "DESIGN OF FLEXIBLE GRIPPER WITH SOLIDWORKS SOFTWARE AND PROTOTYPE WITH 3D PRINTING"

Overview/Abstract: Start with a brief abstract of your project. You can use the abstract provided in your document: "This project leverages the advantages of additive manufacturing by focusing on the design of a flexible gripper using SolidWorks software, followed by 3d printing for prototyping. The engineered gripper is designed to seamlessly adapt to diverse object shapes and sizes, enhancing its versatility in handling a wide range of items. SolidWorks is chosen for its robust modeling capabilities, facilitating precise design iterations. The use of 3d printing expedites the creation of physical prototypes, enabling practical testing and refinement of the gripper's functionality. This interdisciplinary approach harmonizes digital design and additive manufacturing to create an adaptable and efficient gripping mechanism.". You can also mention the key software and technologies used: "Key Words: Additive Manufacturing (AM), Solid works, 3D printer, Prototype.".
